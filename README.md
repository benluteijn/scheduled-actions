A library for management, operations and persistence of scheduled actions
=
[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/spinnaker/scheduled-actions.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/spinnaker/scheduled-actions)
Below are the features:

* Create and register an ```com.netflix.scheduledactions.ActionInstance``` which gives a handle to the implemented action (```com.netflix.scheduledactions.Action```)
* Actions can be scheduled using a type of ```com.netflix.scheduledactions.triggers.Trigger```. For example, a scheduled trigger for an action can be a cron expression
* Track and monitor the action executions with ability to add a listener for events like onCancel(), onStart(), onComplete(), onError(), etc.
* ```Action```s can be executed in an ad-hoc manner too.
* ```Action```s can provide cancel hook using the onCancel() callback of an ```com.netflix.scheduledactions.ExecutionListener```
* Enable/Disable ```ActionInstance```s and corresponding scheduled triggers
* Persist and view a history of ```execution```s for a given ```ActionInstance``` using ```scheduled-actions-cassandra``` module

This library is *not* a workflow engine *nor* a scheduling library (It uses ```fenzo-triggers``` library for time based scheduling).

Download instructions for gradle:

```groovy
repositories {

dependencies {
    compile "com.netflix.scheduledactions:${artifactId}:${version}" // For example: compile "com.netflix.scheduledactions:scheduled-actions-core:0.3"
}
```

Usage
=

```com.netflix.scheduledactions.ActionsOperator``` is the primary class for registering, enabling, disabling, executing and cancelling ```ActionInstance```s.

At a high level, users need to follow below steps to use this library:

1. Implement an action
2. Create an ActionInstance
3. Create an ActionsOperator instance
4. Register the ActionInstance with ActionsOperator

Details and sample code for each step is explained below:

#### 1. Implement an Action ####

Create an action by either implementing ```Action``` interface or by extending ```ActionSupport``` class

```java
public class MyAction implements Action {
    // Implement methods here...
}
```

```java
public class MyAction extends ActionSupport {
    // Implement or/and override methods here...
}
```

#### 2. Create an ActionInstance ####

```ActionInstance``` provides a builder to create an action instance

```java
ActionInstance actionInstance = ActionInstance.newActionInstance()
    .withName("Process Items")
    .withGroup("MyApplication")
    .withAction(MyAction.class)
    .withOwners("sthadeshwar@netflix.com")
    .withWatchers("foobar-team@netflix.com")
    .build();
```

A ```Trigger``` can be associated with an ```ActionInstance```

```java
ActionInstance actionInstance = ActionInstance.newActionInstance()
    .withName("Process Items")
    .withGroup("MyApplication")
    .withAction(MyAction.class)
    .withTrigger(new CronTrigger("0 0 0/1 * * ?"))  // Run the action every hour
    .build();
```

Specify a timeout for your action execution

```java
ActionInstance actionInstance = ActionInstance.newActionInstance()
    .withName("Process Items")
    .withGroup("MyApplication")
    .withAction(MyAction.class)
    .withTrigger(new CronTrigger("0 0 0/1 * * ?"))  // Run the action every hour
    .withExecutionTimeoutInSeconds(45*60L)  // Timeout after 45 minutes
    .build();
```

Specify an ```ExecutionListener``` for your action

```java
MyListener implements ExecutionListener {
    // Implement methods here...
}

ActionInstance actionInstance = ActionInstance.newActionInstance()
    .withName("Process Items")
    .withGroup("MyApplication")
    .withAction(MyAction.class)
    .withTrigger(new CronTrigger("0 0 0/1 * * ?"))  // Run the action every hour
    .withExecutionTimeoutInSeconds(45*60L)  // Timeout after 45 minutes
    .withExecutionListener(MyListener.class)
    .build();
```

A concurrent execution strategy can also be setup for the action instance. The strategy can be set to one of the following:
* REJECT - skip the action execution if one is already running (default)
* ALLOW - execute all ```Execution```s concurrently
* REPLACE - cancel the previous one and run the new one

This can be configured while creating the ```ActionInstance```

```java
ActionInstance actionInstance = ActionInstance.newActionInstance()
    .withName("Process Items")
    .withGroup("MyApplication")
    .withAction(MyAction.class)
    .withTrigger(new CronTrigger("0 0 0/1 * * ?"))  // Run the action every hour
    .withExecutionTimeoutInSeconds(45*60L)  // Timeout after 45 minutes
    .withExecutionListener(MyListener.class)
    .withConcurrentExecutionStrategy(ConcurrentExecutionStrategy.ALLOW)
    .build();
```
#### 3. Create an ActionsOperator instance ####

For creating an instance of ActionsOperator, use the static factory method in ActionsOperator class

```java
ActionsOperator.getInstance(...);
```

The getInstance() method above takes following parameters:

1. DaoConfigurer - a DAO implementations holder class. If using ```scheduled-actions-cassandra``` library, then the Cassandra DAO implementations
can be used. If not, use the existing InMemoryXXXDao implementations
2. Executor - an implementation of ```com.netflix.scheduledactions.executors.Executor``` interface. Use the ```com.netflix.scheduledactions.executors.ExecutorFactory```
to get an executor
3. int - the size of the scheduler thread pool

So, assuming the ```scheduled-actions-cassandra``` library is being used, below is the sample code for creating an ActionsOperator instance

```java
Keyspace keyspace = <Astyanax keyspace instance>
DaoConfigurer daoConfigurer = new DaoConfigurer(new CassandraActionInstanceDao(keyspace), new CassandraTriggerDao(keyspace))
Executor executor = ExecutorFactory.getDefaultExecutor(new CassandraExecutionDao(keyspace), 20)     // 20 is the thread pool size for the executor
ActionsOperator actionsOperator = ActionsOperator.getInstance(daoConfigurer, executor, 20)
```

#### 4. Register the ActionInstance with ActionsOperator ####

Once you have a ```ActionInstance```, you can register it with the ```ActionsOperator```

```java
ActionsOperator actionsOperator = ActionsOperator.getInstance();
actionsOperator.registerActionInstance(actionInstance);
```

Other Features
=

#### Vew action execution history ####

```java
List<Execution> executions = actionsOperator.getExecutions(actionInstance.getId());
```

#### Ad-hoc execution of the action ####

If you want to execute your ```Action``` apart from being executed by the ```Trigger``` (if ```ActionInstance``` is created with a trigger), then
you can use ```ActionsOperator``` to execute the ```ActionInstance``` as well

```java
actionsOperator.execute(actionInstance);
// OR
actionsOperator.execute(actionInstanceId);
```

#### Cancel an action execution ####

A best case attempt will be made to cancel the execution by causing an ```InterruptedException``` to the ```Executor``` thread

```java
actionsOperator.cancel(execution);
// OR
actionsOperator.cancel(executionId);
```
